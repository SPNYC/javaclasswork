Important things to keep in mind for this course:
    1) Pay attention during the class.
    2) Before each class I will be sharing short videos and the slides.
     It's a must that you go through those slides
     and watch the videos in the courseAnnouncement channel.
    3) A lot of Practice.
    4) When practicing if you face any issues don't spend more
    than 15 minutes take a screenshort and post in the technical
    support channel.
   =================================================================
  Why we are here?
    1) TO be automation engineers.
 What do automation engeeners do?
  They test software but mainly you will be testing websites
  and mobil apps by writing the piece of software that will test
  the website automatically.
  Build the system for them to test very fasting than the human.
Why we are learning Java?
    Java is a programming language that we will be using to
communicate with the computer so that we can guide the computer on how
to test a website automatically.
    If we don't use the grammar properly the computer will not be able
    to understand the language.
How Programming languages work?
    They work in a very similar fashion just like how languages work
    They have grammar rules, vocabulary, punctuation etc.
    In this part in the course will be learning these rules for Java.
What is IntelliJ?
    IntellinJ is a software that we will be using to write java code just
    like we use microsoft word to write English. It has many features
    like it can find and fix issues in our code. It can suggest improvements.
    It can assist you to organize you code and so many other things.
 What is a project in intelleJ?
    a project is nothing but a folder that we create to organize our
    code just like we create folders on our computers to organize files.
 How to create a project?
    1) File>New>Project.
    2) once you follow the above steps ypu will see a pop
    3) provide the name for the project and click on create.
 What is a package?
    A package is nothing but another folder inside the project folder
    we create packages to organize code.
 How can I create a package?
    1) Doudle click scr folder > new> package
    2) once the pop-up appears enter the same for the package.
How to create Notes.txt?
    1) Double click on scr > new> file
    2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name of the file and
    the extention .txt
What is a class?
    A class is a java program where we will be writing our code.
    Inside the class we will be creating main method and for now
    we eill all of our code inside the main method.
How to create a class?
    1) Double click on package> new> java class
    2) name the class> enter
Some shortcuts to write code quickly:
    1) write "main" > enter> intelliJ will right the method automatically
    2) to print something on console we right "sout" and hit...
What are comments:
    Comments are like notes we write with java code to explain how the code
    is working. These comments are ignored by java.
    1) // one line comment
    2) /*    */ - multiline comments
Syntax:
    is set of rules that we must follow to write java code just like
    we follow punctuation when we write English.
