Arithmatic Operations in Java:
Note:
    1) To rename something we should use refactor feature from IntelleJ.
    It automaticly renames everything. Right click and then select the
    refactor feature.
    ShortCut for Mac is different.

Modules operator/remainder (%)
    when we use int data type we can use this operator to get the
    remainder part. Ex. 11/5 we will get remainder 1.

String Concatenation
    1)Attaches two string in one string.
    String result="Massi"+10 =>Messi10
    the result will always be a type of String. Those two data types will be combined.
    2) Java executes the code from top to bottom and from left to right.
    But this can be different if we use () parenthesis.

 ShortHandOperators:
    += , -=, /=, *=, %=, ++, --

 Type casting:
    is a process of converting one data type to another.
    it;s very rare that we will be doing type casting.

Relational Operators:
    to compare 2 or more data.
    f.e.
    int num1=10;
    int num2=20;
    num1>num2 => False
    num1<num2 => True
    num1==num2 => False
    num1!=num2 => True
    num>1=num2  => num1>num2 or num1==num2 => False
    num1<=num2 => num1<num2 or num1==num2 => True
