What is variabbles?
    Whe we have to make a computer do something to us
    we have to provide the computer
    with instructions and data. To store this data we need something that
    can help us retrieve this information when we need it.
    Variables help us store this data.
    There are 8 basic types of variables in Java. These are called primitive data types.
    1) byte 2) short 3) int  4) int  5) float  6) double
    7) char  8)boolean
Data types to store simple numbers:
    When ever we have whole numbers the numbers without without
    the decimal parts like 10, 50, 100000, 666, 8888885, we use the below data types
    byte, short, int, long .it depends on the size of the numbers.
    But 99% of the time we will be using int data type to store whole numbers.
Notes:
    1) All primitive data types starts with lowcase letters like byte, short,
    int and etc.
    2) In java First letter of all words is in Uppercase always variables:
    BooleanDemo
    VariableDemo
    variables: lowcase letter and then Upper
    myAge
    areYouHungry
Rules:
    1)we can't have the same name variables twice in java class or method.
    2) Java is case Sensitive which means for Java age and AGE are totally
    two different things.
    3) we can update the value of variable as many times as we want.
    4) If we want to print multiple variable values in a single line we can use
    String concatenation.
    5) we can't access a variable before declaring it.
    6) we can't ask to print the value of something if we don;t initialize it.
Data Type:
    is a mechanism that helps computer to store specific type of information
    and also help it to perform canculation on that information.
Data types to store floating point Number/decimal number:
    Whenever we have to store floating point numbers like 10.5, 2.3
    -5.6, 0.0001 etc. we use below data types:
    1) float
    2) double
    99% of the time double is used and that what we as tester will be using.
Data type to store characters:
    char is the data type that we use to store the single characters
    like 'a', 'z', '-', '+', '1', '@' etc. we can store numbers, letters,
    special characters in char data type.
Data types to store true/false:
    we use data type boolean to store ONLY true/false in java.
    is it raining=false
    are you hungry=true;
Data type to store words:
    we can use String data types to store multiple characters together:
    like "USA", "New York", "`I'm starving and I mean it", "2956984ykjg",
    "&^$#&^%(&^(*".
    String is a none-primitive data type (Advanced) data type, because
    that's why we use Uppercase for String.
Arithmetic operations:
    Addition (+)
    Subtraction (-)
    Multiplication (*)
    Division (/)
    Modules (%)
